# Contributing to Expo Rich Text Editor

We love your input! We want to make contributing to `expo-rte` as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

We use Jest for unit testing and Detox for E2E testing. When adding new features:

1. Add unit tests in `__tests__/` directory
2. Add E2E tests for user-facing features
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Test Structure

```javascript
describe('RichTextEditor', () => {
  it('should render with default props', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle formatting correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## üìù Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration is included in the project.

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React Native and Expo conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Formatting

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```
